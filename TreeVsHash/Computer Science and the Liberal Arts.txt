Perhaps it is my four years of high school Latin but I always associate the liberal arts with freedom  Historically of course this was the direction of study pursued by those who were free to spend their time delving into such areas as logic arithmetic and rhetoric while the less privileged found themselves apprenticed to craftsmen in order to acquire a means of livelihood  While the first path would presumably prepare the student for pursuing a wide variety of interests the second would establish the apprentice on the road leading directly to a particular craft or trade  Today we think of the liberal arts as a course of general study which will equip students with critical thinking skills with the ability to communicate effectively both orally and in writing and most importantly with the ability to continue learning in a world where swift change could make very narrow training rapidly obsolete  Preparing for a particular career is generally a far less important goal Thus while the study of the liberal arts was often available only to those who were already free because of wealth or circumstance today we like to view it as an opportunity for greater freedom in the choice of a future career or profession   Equipped with a broad knowledge of the arts and the natural and social sciences and with the skills to use that knowledge successfully for continued learning reasoned and principled decision making and effective communication the liberal arts graduate should be poised to pursue a diversity of careers  
Unfortunately liberal arts colleges have been rather slow in recognizing the opportunity that the study of computer science provides in achieving these ends  In fact those who defend the appropriateness of computer science as a field of study in a liberal arts institution are frequently met with some skepticism from their colleagues  Furthermore while most such institutions do offer the major or some sort of concentration the impact on the general student body has not been very pervasive  Not long ago a respected liberal arts college in Michigan announced its decision to drop the computer science major from its offerings  While this action was undoubtedly based on the small number of majors in the program need for this decision immediately raised the question of why there weren’t a great many students taking these courses  Twenty first century graduates will be beginning their careers in a world in which the computer is almost omnipresent and yet they frequently will have only the most rudimentary knowledge of the important ideas and principles of computer science or the social and ethical implications of technology  Their ability to make contributions to the natural and social sciences will undoubtedly be limited by their capacity to make full use of the ideas arising in computer science and their policy decisions and vision could very well be impoverished by a failure to address ethical issues related to technology  
After the precipitous drop in computer science enrollments during the first decade of this century many small liberal arts colleges like their large university counterparts found themselves with significantly diminished numbers of majors  While the most common explanation for these smaller populations probably included a reference to outsourcing or off shoring this is hardly an explanation in the context of a liberal arts institution  Most students who pursue majors in art history the classics or even psychology do not expect to find employment directly related to their major with only an undergraduate degree  Selecting such a major permitted them to nurture their interest in a particular field while simultaneously developing competencies such as research and analytical skills and the ability to communicate effectively which would make them valuable as future managers leaders and decision makers regardless of their major  
From my perspective the primary issue is that neither our students nor our colleagues really understand what computer science is  Consequently they do not recognize the opportunities it provides for practicing precise logical and algorithmic thinking for developing creative solutions to difficult problems and perhaps most importantly for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches  Computer science regularly employs ideas from subject areas as diverse as linguistics physics logic mathematics and psychology and then applies them across the spectrum of human endeavors
Our homes are full of appliances and machines that do a single thing:  toasters toast washers wash vacuums sweep  But such limited application is not true about a computer; it is a universal machine  Equipped with the appropriate software that one device can be used to edit photographs to send mail to prepare income taxes to play a game to watch a movie to solve a differential equation  The list goes on and on limited only by the creativity of a programmer who can harness the computing power to provide yet another solution to a waiting problem  The person who knows how to program can write his or her own applications  Think of the power and freedom available to those who know how to make this machine do their bidding  And even those who have no interest or need to program can enjoy a significantly enhanced world view by appropriate exposure to both the possibilities and the limitations of that universal machine and the programs that drive it  Sometimes just knowing what can be done is a very liberating experience
Furthermore an introduction to computer science has benefit far beyond the ability to write applications  Many of the advantages of a liberal arts education come from the ways one learns to think and solve problems and the methods one develops for analyzing and critiquing an argument  Computer science contributes to these skill sets with what is usually called algorithmic thinking and because a computer carries out the instructions exactly as given programming requires clarity of thought and a strict logical correctness that is seldom demanded elsewhere  
In most programming situations there is an input which determines the start state and there is an expected output which reflects the goal of the system  For example the input might be a list of words which in the start state could be in any random order  The goal is to output that list in alphabetical order  In between lies the algorithm which gives a precise list of steps that will transform the system from this start state to the desired goal state  Once that set of steps is encoded as a program and compiled the machine will carry out those instructions precisely as stated  This may or may not do exactly what the author intended  Students can easily submit proofs or exercises in a mathematics course hoping that they are correct or almost correct and hence deserving of at least partial credit  But while programs may contain some subtle errors that inadequate student testing may not reveal most of the time aspiring programmers are acutely aware when their programs do not work correctly  Often a source of frustration programming bugs openly manifest a failure in logic or an inadequate analysis of the problem  Almost correct will never satisfy the computer which executes precisely what the programmer wrote as opposed to what he or she meant
But beyond being able to find a correct solution computer science also cares about efficiency  Algorithms for solving a problem must be evaluated in the light of space and time requirements  This is based on careful mathematical analysis to distinguish the properties of one algorithm which will take hours to run from another that can solve the same problem in seconds  And in the face of unbounded expectation about what a computer can accomplish computer science teaches that there are limits to computing  There are problems which we know cannot be solved by any program and others that cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time  All of this takes detailed analysis and careful proof  
Far from being a course of study which prepares students for precisely one career path a well designed computer science program equips its graduates with knowledge of theory and principles and compels them to think in a very careful and organized fashion to construct solutions to complex problems  And those problems can arise in almost any realm of human inquiry from the analysis of environmental issues to the design of theatrical sets  
Finally while computer science has a great deal to contribute to a liberal arts education it is also true that the liberal arts have a great deal to contribute to a computer science education  Certainly the excellent communication skills the emphasis on analysis and critical thinking and the desire to look at a situation from multiple viewpoints which are strongly supported by a liberal arts education all contribute to the development of an aspiring computer scientist  And many of the successes in computer science applications spring directly from applications of theoretical results in multiple disciplines  Compiler writers depend on the four classes of grammars developed by Chomsky  Random number generators quote theoretical results from abstract algebra  Robot designers employ logic for knowledge representation and reasoning and they study learning theories from cognitive science  These contributions are just as important as the physics and statistical analysis one might more readily identify    The computer scientist who has been broadly exposed to a variety of disciplines has a greater arsenal of weapons at her disposal when it comes to solving a problem
Computer science and the liberal arts have much to offer each other  Most graduates will find themselves empowered by a solid introduction to the many great ideas in computer science and they will have much greater freedom because of their ability to understand and use them  Similarly the computer scientist is liberated from a narrow focus by the breadth of ideas and skills which a solid liberal arts preparation ensures  It is time to embrace the possibilities much more broadly so that graduates will not only be able to use the machines of technology but also benefit from the ideas algorithmic thinking and rich interdisciplinary applications that a serious study of computer science can provide
